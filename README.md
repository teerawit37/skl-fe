# Skilllane Challenge with NextJS (TypeScript) 

This is a Frontend Typescript Project using:
* NextJS (TypeScript)
* Redux (Example UseCase)
* SCSS

## Demo
* Live Demo : <https://skl-fe.vercel.app/signin/>

Since I am using vercel hosting, there seems to be a problem with setting cookies, so it may not work 100%.


## Getting Started

1. clone `https://github.com/teerawit37/skl-fe.git`

2. install the dependencies and start the development server.

```bash
cd skl-fe

npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


## Deploy on other Hosting Options

In your own hosting provider, run the build script once, which builds the production application in the .next folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

After building, the start script starts a Node.js server that supports hybrid pages, serving both statically generated and server-side rendered pages, and API Routes.

```bash
npm run start
```

<b>If you want static file, run the deploy script once, which builds the production application in the out folder.<b>

```bash
npm run deploy
```
